                                            CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post a privacy
                                            policy. The law's reach stretches well beyond California to require any person or company in the United States
                                            (and conceivably the world) that operates websites collecting Personally Identifiable Information from California
                                            consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information being collected
                                            and those individuals or companies with whom it is being shared. - See more at: http://consumercal.org/california-online-privacy-protection-act-caloppa/#sthash.0FdRbT51.dpuf

                                            they include have played a significant role in the development of data protection laws around the globe. Understanding
                                            the Fair Information Practice Principles and how they should be implemented is critical to comply with the various
                                            privacy laws that protect personal information.
